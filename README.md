## Overview
The **PCD Project** is a comprehensive solution for analyzing and processing Point Cloud Data (PCD) using advanced computational techniques. With the increasing use of 3D scanning and LiDAR technologies, efficient handling, visualization, and manipulation of point cloud datasets have become crucial. This project provides a robust framework for performing key operations on PCD, including filtering, segmentation, clustering, and feature extraction.

## Scope
This project is designed to support research, academic studies, and real-world applications in fields such as:

### Autonomous Vehicles
Enhancing perception through point cloud segmentation and object recognition.

### Geospatial Mapping
Processing LiDAR data for terrain analysis and urban planning.

### Medical Imaging
3D reconstruction of anatomical structures from scanned data.

### Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR)
Building immersive environments with 3D point cloud data.

### Industrial Inspection
Automated defect detection in manufactured components.

## Features

### Point Cloud Processing
Efficiently loads, processes, and manipulates point cloud data.

### Visualization
Provides interactive 3D rendering for data inspection and analysis.

### Noise Reduction
Implements filtering techniques such as statistical outlier removal and voxel grid filtering.

### Clustering & Segmentation
Detects and groups objects using algorithms like DBSCAN and RANSAC.

### Feature Extraction
Computes geometric properties, including curvature, normals, and surface reconstruction.

### Scalability
Designed to handle large-scale datasets with optimized performance.

## Installation
